# 💡 Deep Dive into C# Asynchronous Programming

## ❔Why does this repository exist

When I started learning the Asynchronous programming in C# I appealed to Microsoft official documentation as usual and the problem I encountered with was the lack of information about **_What asynchronous programming in C# essentially is_** 🔦. Official documentation doesn't really provide much information about what are the processes behind the basic `async/await` constructions that allow C# manipulate with threads and execute asynchronous programming. Obviously, there are some decent use cases described in Microsoft documentation, but it is not enough for curious programmers that want to know their tool **_as deep as possible_**. I hope this 🔭 **_Deep Dive_** 🔭 will help you to figure out what processes are hidden behind the scene of 🔀 **_C# Asynchronous Programming_** 🔀.

Now let's begin our amusing trip from [basics](./Basics/README.md) to bring you up to date!
